## Data Structure Changes

```json
{
  "name": "Farm Name",
  "address": "123 Farm Rd",
  "lat": 41.123,
  "lng": -73.456,
  "website": "https://farm.com",
  "place_id": "ChIJ...",
  "u_pick_apples": true,
  "reservation_required": true,
  "notes": "Farm notes",
  "organic": true,
  "season": "Fall",
  "season_description": "Apple season...",
  "season_start_week": 34,
  "season_end_week": 42
}
```

### After (Consolidated Structure)
```json
{
  "name": "Farm Name",
  "address": "123 Farm Rd", 
  "lat": 41.123,
  "lng": -73.456,
  "website": "https://farm.com",
  "place_id": "ChIJ...",
  "fruits": [
    {
      "type": "apples",
      "notes": "Farm notes",
      "season_description": "Apple season...",
      "season_start_week": 34,

    }
  ]
}
```

## Key Improvements

1. **Eliminated Duplication**: Farm information (name, address, coordinates, website) is stored once per farm
2. **Preserved All Data**: Every fruit entry from the original files is preserved
3. **Enhanced Structure**: Each farm can now have multiple fruit types with individual seasonal data
4. **Maintained Compatibility**: All original fields are preserved in the fruit objects

## Data Quality Notes

- **Fishkill Farms**: Appears twice with slightly different coordinates (41.5180421 vs 41.537) - this may indicate two different locations or a data entry error
- **Address Variations**: Some farms have minor address differences (e.g., "Rd" vs "Road") but same coordinates
- **Missing Data**: Some entries have empty notes fields, which is preserved in the consolidated structure

## Verification Status: ✅ COMPLETE

All 67 original fruit entries have been successfully preserved in the consolidated structure. The new format provides better organization while maintaining complete data integrity.
