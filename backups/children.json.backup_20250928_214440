Beyond the waterfalls, Letchworth has 60+ miles of hiking trails (many short and family-friendly), playgrounds and large picnic areas, a nature center with interactive exhibits, and even opportunities for adventure like rafting or riding in a hot-air balloon above the gorge (in summer). In winter, snow tubing and guided nature walks are offered. With cabins, campsites, and year-round natural beauty, Letchworth provides a fantastic outdoor experience in any season.",

    "full_description": "Boldt Castle is a magnificent 120-room castle set on Heart Island in the St. Lawrence River, built in the early 1900s and left abandoned for decades before being restored. Visiting is like stepping into a fairy tale. Families take a short ferry or tour boat from Alexandria Bay to reach the island. Once there, you can explore the castle’s grand halls, sweeping staircase, and furnished rooms (children often love imagining princesses and knights roaming the corridors). The grounds feature beautiful gardens, a stone children’s playhouse, and a picturesque Power House and clock tower by the water’s edge. Informational displays tell the romantic and tragic story of how the castle came to be. Kids will especially enjoy the winding staircase to the castle dome for a view, and feeding the giant fish visible in the clear river waters from the docks. Open from mid-May through mid-October, Boldt Castle makes for a magical half-day adventure in the Thousand Islands.",

    "full_description": "The Farmers’ Museum immerses families in rural American life circa 1845. This open-air museum features a recreated country village with historic buildings (blacksmith shop, one-room schoolhouse, general store, etc.) populated by costumed interpreters demonstrating period crafts and chores. Children can watch (or help) the printer set type, see a blacksmith hammering iron, or try traditional games on the village green. The working farm has barns with friendly heritage-breed animals — think sheep, pigs, chickens, and Milking Shorthorn cows — and daily activities like cow milking or feeding time that kids can observe. A highlight for many families is the Empire State Carousel: a beautiful hand-carved merry-go-round featuring 25 animals native to New York (like a deer, eagle, or beaver) to ride on. The museum is generally open April through October, with special events and limited operations in winter, and provides a fun, educational glimpse into the past in a very kid-friendly way."

The park features over 300 animals of 100 species, from big cats like Jaguars and lions to kangaroos, wallabies, zebra, bison, and capybara. Many exhibits are designed for interaction: you can hand-feed apples to camels, brush Nigerian dwarf goats in the petting area, and even book special encounters to hold a sloth or pet an anteater. There are multiple play areas for kids, including a prehistoric themed playground and a small dinosaur park with animatronic dinos. Generally open mid-April through late fall, Animal Adventure Park provides an unforgettable, hands-on animal experience that’s both fun and educational for children and adults.",
